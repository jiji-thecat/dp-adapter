# Design Pattern - Adapter pattern

## Description

![dp-adapter](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-adapter/assets/104809324/2f8e0b62-2de9-4ea2-a5a7-43ed2c4eb375)

The Adapter pattern is a design pattern used to make two incompatible interfaces compatible. It allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. For example, let's consider a scenario where we have a `Cat` class with a method `makeSound()` that returns "meow", and a `Dolphin` class with a method `ultrasound()` that returns some kind of sound. Although the `Dolphin` class doesn't have an `animalSound()` method, the `ultrasound()` method can be seen as producing a sound from an animal's perspective. Users expect that when they call the `animalSound()` method, they get some kind of value from both classes. By using the Adapter pattern, we can achieve this compatibility.

To implement this pattern, we define an interface called `AdapterInterface` with the `animalSound()` method as a virtual function. Then, we implement a `DolphinAdapter` class which inherits both the `Dolphin` class and the `AdapterInterface`. Since the `DolphinAdapter` class implements the `AdapterInterface`, it must provide an implementation for the `animalSound()` method. Here, we can call the `ultrasound()` method. Now, users can call the `animalSound()` method on both classes and receive the expected sound - either the cat's meow or the dolphin's ultrasound.

For the scenario described above:

- Adapter: `DolphinAdapter` class.
- Adaptee: `Dolphin` class.
- Target: `AdapterInterface`.

This application features interactions between a human and an alien. The alien does not speak human language initially, but if the user clicks the `Get close with Alien` button at the bottom, the alien will reply in human language. In the code, I've implemented the `Alien` class using the Adapter pattern, triggered when the `Get close with Alien` button is pressed.
